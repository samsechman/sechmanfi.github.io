# Sechman Financial Website

This is a recreated version of the Sechman Financial website. The site is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and modern financial services website.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- Modern and clean user interface with smooth animations
- Navigation menu with smooth scrolling to different sections
- News section with ability to add new articles
- Testimonial slider to showcase client feedback
- Contact form with validation
- Service cards highlighting financial services offered

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure of the website
- `styles.css` - CSS styles for layout and design
- `script.js` - JavaScript for interactivity and animations
- `news.html` - News articles page with admin interface to add articles
- `images/` - Directory for website images
  - `hero-bg.jpg.html` - Placeholder for hero background image
  - `placeholder-image.jpg.html` - Placeholder for about section image

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the website
   - You can do this by double-clicking the file or right-clicking and selecting "Open with" your preferred browser
   - Alternatively, you can use a local development server if you have one available
3. For development, you can use any code editor of your choice

## Important: Replace Image Placeholders

The repository includes HTML placeholders for images instead of actual image files. You'll need to:

1. Replace `images/hero-bg.jpg.html` with an actual image file named `hero-bg.jpg`
2. Replace `images/placeholder-image.jpg.html` with an actual image file named `placeholder-image.jpg`
3. Update the image paths in `index.html` and `styles.css` if necessary

Note: The website has fallbacks in place for missing images, so it will still display correctly even before you add the actual image files.

## News Articles Feature

The website includes a dedicated news articles section:

- View all articles on the News page
- "Add New Article" feature for administrators to publish new content
- Responsive grid layout for article display
- Simple form for adding new articles with title, date, image, summary, and content

## Customization

To customize this website:

1. Replace the placeholder text with your own content
2. Replace the placeholder images with your own images
3. Update the color scheme by changing the CSS variables in the `:root` section of `styles.css`
4. Add or remove sections as needed in the HTML file
5. Add real articles to the News section
